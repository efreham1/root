# How do you work in a team? Do you follow a certain pattern, or do you often take on a certain role?
I feel like I work well in a group, it allows me to see things from different perspectives and I like discussing problems in different ways with my teammates. I like to think I usually donâ€™t have a certain role but instead can be more adaptive to what the group needs. If the group is lacking a team leader I have no problem stepping up to take that role but at the same time have no problem letting other people lead.
 
# Do you get something out of working in a group, or do you prefer working alone?
As I stated previously I enjoy working in a group because people look at problems differently and then discussing the problem can lead to a better solution. On the other hand working alone can be more productive, if you think you have a solution to a problem you can immediately work towards that solution and can skip the discussion. 
 
# Compare how much you have learned during the project in comparison to the other parts of the course and think about how you learn best.
I have learned a lot during this project, mostly about how to work in a bigger group and with using tools like Github on a bigger larger project. 
 
# How has logging your time worked?
I didn't logg my time. 

# What was your "Biggest fail" and "Biggest win", i.e., the biggest problem you ran into and the smartest or best thing you did.
# Biggest win:
Always actively participating, when I was done with the task I was assigned I started helping out my teammates with their tasks. 

# Biggest fail: 
Not logging the time and not using pull request in a correct way
