# Individual Reflection of Fredrik Hammarberg
## How do you work in a team? Do you follow a certain pattern, or do you often take on a certain role?
I feel like I often take on a role of some kind of leader. I often end up doing quite a lot in the team as well.
In this project I think I did both these things. I do however feel that I did it well and didn't run over the
other team members.
## Do you get something out of working in a group, or do you prefer working alone?
I think working in a group is very good for me since it makes it so that I have to discuss what I'm doing and I
therefore understand it better. I also like that I don't have to know everything myself and can instead lean on other team members.
## Compare how much you have learned during the project in comparison to the other parts of the course and think about how you learn best.
I'd say I've learnt more during the project that during the other parts of the course. I think this is because 
I learn best by doing and researching on my own which is a lot of what this project has been about.
## How has logging your time worked?
I didn't log my time, it is one of the things that we didn't do correctly.
## What was your "Biggest fail" and "Biggest win"?
### Biggest Fail
My biggest fail was probably not stepping in and changing up the groups and instead just powring on coding with
my group. Beacause of this the other group literally did nothing in the garbage collector and instead just
worked with the stack scanner.
### Biggest Win
Ironically I think my biggest win is some of the code I wrote in the garabage collector. I feel like some of the
solutions and implementations I did was genuinely very good and smart.
