#Individual reflection of Olof Lindström

##How do you work in a team? Do you follow a certain pattern, or do you often take on a certain role?

If it could benefit the outcome of the project, I tend to be willing to compromise to a large degree. The most important thing for a successful project, in my opinion, is to avoid conflicts between the team members. I would say that I focus quite a lot on the atmosphere that surrounds the team and its work. However, I often have a rather strong opinion on what is the correct thing to do under certain circumstances, and I find it important to criticize and scrutinize ideas and concepts. I pay a great deal of attention to details – a trait that could be both a strength and a weakness. In spirit I like to be part of the driving force of the team, but hitherto I have not occupied the role that quickly outlines the entire project and designs and makes drafts of all the modules. Rather, I am inclined to work on specific parts of the project, which I can explore more in depth. In addition to this, I like to look out for general misconceptions and flaws, as well as bugs.

##Do you get something out of working in a group, or do you prefer working alone?

When the teamwork is good I enjoy working in a group. I have been part of some projects that managed to accomplish way more than any of the individuals could have done had they worked alone. Also the process and the dynamics of the group could be interesting.

##Compare how much you have learned during the project in comparison to the other parts of the course and think about how you learn best.

This time my programming skills have not developed that much during the project, because of its theoretical nature; I have mainly explored the stack by creating a stack scanner, a task that sometimes felt more like computer architecture than imperative programming. However, the way the stack functions has always seemed rather obscure to me, so I did find it valuable to be able to explore this. There are examples of past projects that helped me improve my programming skills as well, so I do not think that there is anything about the setting that prohibits this –  I only happened to pick a task that turned out to be something else than I expected.

##How has logging your time worked?

The logging of time worked fairly well. These are my results:
(*) Collaborative work on the stack scanner: 25 hours
(*) Individual work on the stack scanner: 35 hours
(*) Writing of report: 20 hours
(*) Additional meetings, which is listed in our project report

##What was your "Biggest fail" and "Biggest win", i.e., the biggest problem you ran into and the smartest or best thing you did.

"Biggest win": Identifying and tracking data from memory addresses on the stack, as well as asserting that the data was where it should be.

"Biggest fail": I spent too much time trying to optimize the filtering of memory addresses, which eventually proved not to be that useful.
