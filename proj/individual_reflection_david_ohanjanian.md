## How do you work in a team? Do you follow a certain pattern, or do you often take on a certain role?
I see myself in the position of taking initiatives in the team. Usually I was very eager with starting to code and
very happy to present and explain code during our meetings.
## Do you get something out of working in a group, or do you prefer working alone?
It is usually easier to work alone if you know what you are doing.
Although in this project, I preferred working with a team, as problems and questions arose during the
course of this project, we could help each-other and discuss various approaches and solutions.
## Compare how much you have learned during the project in comparison to the other parts of the course and think about how you learn best.
I gained a deeper understanding of computer architecture, as I was a member of the internal group responsible for the
stack scanner. Hence, compared to other parts of the course, my acquired knowledge was narrowed, for this specific reason.
I also became more skillful in visualizing and simplifying complex systems, as having a shared responsibility over the project 
presentation, we had to analyze and understand the GC on multiple levels, in order to deliver a meaningful and comprehensible presentation. This
very task was also something that differed compared to other tasks throughout the course with its various achievements and assignments.
In summary, other parts of the course delivered a broader set of knowledge, while this project,
it a deeper meaning.
## How has logging your time worked?
I didn't log my time, it is one of the things that we didn't do correctly.
## What was your "Biggest fail" and "Biggest win"?
### Biggest Fail
As we got stuck on our problems in the stack scanner group, it delayed our involvement
in other parts of the project. Sure we got help, but by the time we were done with our assignment, rest
of the GC was almost done.
### Biggest Win
Always actively participating in the project with the curiosity of learning.
Lastly, we made a working GC!
