## How do you work in a team? Do you follow a certain pattern, or do you often take on a certain role?
I see myself in the position of taking initiatives in the team. Usually I was very eager with starting to code and
presenting code during our meetings.
## Do you get something out of working in a group, or do you prefer working alone?
It is usually easier to work alone if you know what you are doing.
Regarding this project, I preferred working in a team, as problems and questions arose during the
course of this project and everybody was highly helpful.
## Compare how much you have learned during the project in comparison to the other parts of the course and think about how you learn best.
I gained a deeper understanding of computer architecture, as I was a member of the internal group responsible for the 
stack scanner.Hence, compared to other parts of the course, my acquired knowledge was narrow, for this specific reason.
## How has logging your time worked?
I didn't log my time, it is one of the things that we didn't do correctly.
## What was your "Biggest fail" and "Biggest win"?
### Biggest Fail
As we got stuck on our problems in the stack scanner group, it delayed our involvement
in the rest of the project. Sure we got help, but by the time we were done with our assignment, rest
of the GC was almost done.
### Biggest Win
Always actively participating in the project and rapidly change groups
after completed tasks. Lastly, we made a GC!
